Testing the GovCMS Distribution with Continuous Integration (CI)

## Overview

This repository contains a set of tools and configurations to help you test the [GovCMS](https://www.govcms.gov.au/) distribution with Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines. GovCMS is a content management system designed for Australian government agencies.

CI is a crucial part of modern software development that allows you to automatically build, test, and deploy your code whenever changes are made to the repository. This ensures that your GovCMS distribution remains reliable and secure.

## Features

- Automated testing of your GovCMS distribution.
- Integration with popular CI services like Travis CI and CircleCI.
- Easy setup with provided configuration files.

## Usage

With CI set up, every time you push changes to your GovCMS distribution repository, the CI pipeline will:

- Build your GovCMS distribution.
- Run automated tests to check for errors and vulnerabilities.
- Deploy the distribution (if configured).

You can monitor the CI pipeline's progress and access build artifacts from the CI service's dashboard.
