# govcms-tests

Testing the GovCMS Distribution with Continuous Integration (CI)

## Overview

This repository contains a set of tools and configurations to help you test the [GovCMS](https://www.govcms.gov.au/) distribution with Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines. GovCMS is a content management system designed for Australian government agencies.

CI is a crucial part of modern software development that allows you to automatically build, test, and deploy your code whenever changes are made to the repository. This ensures that your GovCMS distribution remains reliable and secure.

## Features

- Automated testing of your GovCMS distribution.
- Integration with popular CI services like Travis CI and CircleCI.
- Easy setup with provided configuration files.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up CI for your GovCMS distribution:

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have a GovCMS distribution repository on GitHub.

### Configuration

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/govcms-ci-testing.git
   ```

2. Copy the CI configuration files from this repository to your GovCMS distribution repository. You can copy them manually or use a script to automate the process.

   ```bash
   cp -r govcms-ci-testing/.github your-govcms-repo/
   ```

3. Commit and push the changes to your GovCMS distribution repository:

   ```bash
   cd your-govcms-repo/
   git add .github
   git commit -m "Add CI configuration files"
   git push origin main
   ```

### CI Service Setup

#### Travis CI

1. Go to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) and sign in with your GitHub account.

2. Enable the CI pipeline for your GovCMS distribution repository.

3. Travis CI will automatically detect the `.travis.yml` file in your repository and start running the CI pipeline.

#### CircleCI

1. Go to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) and sign in with your GitHub account.

2. Add your GovCMS distribution repository to CircleCI.

3. CircleCI will automatically detect the `.circleci` directory and start running the CI pipeline.

## Usage

With CI set up, every time you push changes to your GovCMS distribution repository, the CI pipeline will:

- Build your GovCMS distribution.
- Run automated tests to check for errors and vulnerabilities.
- Deploy the distribution (if configured).

You can monitor the CI pipeline's progress and access build artifacts from the CI service's dashboard.
